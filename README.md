Connecting NYU Interactive Media Campuses through Gifs!

MeowSpace is a place for people to come together and talk about almost anything. Using the power of two second webcam recordings, it can bring about a much deeper sense of connection than most other Internet communication mediums.

This version is based on Kyle Greenberg's version of Meowspace and Travis Collins's Meatspace. Special thanks to @ednapiranha, the author of the original software and concept on which this whole thing is based. Without her, none of this would exist.
